Welcome to **Journey of Crafted Insights** ‚Äì a personal archive where I document my ongoing learning across multiple domains, including **AI**, **Algorithms**, and **Tools**. This repository serves as a backup for my Obsidian notes, capturing my reflections, projects, configurations, and experiments over time.

## üå± Project Overview

**Journey of Crafted Insights** is an evolving knowledge base dedicated to the following key areas:

- **AI**: My experiments, research, and projects in the field of artificial intelligence. This includes machine learning models, deep learning architectures, and AI frameworks.
- **Algorithms**: A collection of algorithmic explorations, from basic data structures to advanced problem-solving strategies and coding challenges.
- **Tools**: Notes on development tools, IDE setups, and configurations that I use to optimize my workflow.

Rather than being a traditional documentation project, this repository reflects my ongoing learning and the insights I gain throughout various phases of these domains.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three main folders, each reflecting a core aspect of my knowledge development:

- **AI**: Contains notes, project documents, and research findings related to artificial intelligence and machine learning.
- **Algorithm**: Includes algorithmic studies, coding solutions, and problem-solving techniques.
- **Tools**: Guides and configuration notes for the tools I use to support my work, from code editors to version control and other development utilities.

This structure is meant to provide an intuitive way to navigate the various fields I‚Äôm learning and experimenting with, while also allowing for ongoing growth and addition of new content.

## üß† Learning Philosophy

My goal with this repository is to craft a deeper understanding of each subject I explore, turning raw learning into actionable insights. Each note is a reflection of my thought process, experiments, and evolving understanding. Over time, these notes serve as both a personal reference and a record of my intellectual journey.

## üîÑ Repository Updates

While this repository is primarily for personal use, I make it available for others who may find value in the notes I‚Äôve compiled. Updates and changes are frequent as I continue to refine my understanding of each topic.

## ü§ù Collaboration

Though this is a personal project, I welcome any feedback, discussions, or suggestions. If you have any insights or contributions, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. I‚Äôm always open to learning from others!
